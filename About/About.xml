  <description>Automatically assigns work priorities to colonists based on their skills, user-defined roles, health status, and actual work needs. 

Features:
- Auto-assign priorities based on colonist skills
- Optional role presets (Researcher, Doctor, Farmer, etc.) or fully automatic best-job detection
- **Custom Roles** - create your own roles with drag-and-drop job ordering and importance levels (Disabled, VeryLow, Low, Normal, High, Critical)
- **NEW: Colony Efficiency Dashboard** - comprehensive performance metrics, job bottlenecks, staffing analysis, and efficiency scoring
- **NEW: Real-Time Work Indicators** - color-coded workload levels next to each colonist with detailed tooltips
- **NEW: Skill Coverage Matrix** - interactive grid showing colonist skills vs work types with passion indicators
- **NEW: Pending Work Queue** - see what jobs need doing and who can do them
- **Always-Enabled Jobs** - configure critical jobs (Firefighting, Doctor, Patient care) to be enabled for all colonists regardless of role
- **Solo Survival Mode Toggle** - optional survival mode for single colonist scenarios
- Intelligent secondary job assignment (priorities 2-4)
- Need-based assignment - prioritizes jobs with active work (bills, construction, harvesting, etc.)
- Improved idle detection - automatically assigns more jobs to idle colonists
- Illness/injury response: reduces workload for sick colonists
- Periodic auto-recalculation or manual control
- Integrates directly into the Work tab
- Min/Max worker controls per job type (absolute or percentage-based)
- Compatible with Complex Jobs mod (auto-detects specialized work types)
- Compatible with PriorityMaster mod (extends to 1-99 priority range)
- Composite roles with multi-job workflows (Builder, Demolition, Medic, Industrialist)

Set a colonist's primary role or let the system figure out their best jobs automatically! The system now intelligently focuses on work that actually needs doing.

Compatibility: Works with Complex Jobs, PriorityMaster, and any mod that adds custom work types.</description>
